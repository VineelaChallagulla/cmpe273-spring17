### Abstract

Checking a person against his or her picture ID is labor intensive. Despite machine learning is getting better and better, we want to use image recognition as much as possible and handle in-person check whenever the algorithm doesn't decide.


### Requirements

* implements the photo ID scan upload and saving it to a database.
* implements the live image upload from a camera or mobile phone.
* calculate the matching score for the live image photo against the original stored in the database.

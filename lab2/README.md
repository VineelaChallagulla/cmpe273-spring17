# Access Amazon DynamoDB through AWS Gateway 

This is step-by-step walk through for lab 3 of class cmpe273. The steps are based on following two links. The first link was provided by lecturer which was a blog by aws architect. However, it missed out how to setup IAM for the gateway and second link has complementary instructions for the first link.
